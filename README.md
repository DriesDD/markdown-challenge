### You can alays count on me when you need chicken eggs or a place to crash.

In a group I can help when inspiration is needed, trying to bring together different ideas, and think pragmatically. In other words, trying to keep our feet on the ground but our head in the air.

### A funny story

While arrested by the police in Germany for tresspassing in a coal mine, my fingers were too cold for the finger print scanner to work. So the fingerprint controlling lady cop had to try and warm my fingers with her hands. It was a very romantic moment and I was released without identification due to the overwhelming awkwardness.

#### tl;dr
Love can overcome anything <3
